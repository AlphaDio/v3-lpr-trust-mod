# Bond Market Defines Tweaks
# This file contains global define changes to enhance the bond market system
# These tweaks make credit more accessible and dynamic

NGame = {
	# Increase base credit limit to make debt more viable
	# Default COUNTRY_MIN_CREDIT_BASE = 100000, increasing to 200000 for more borrowing capacity
	COUNTRY_MIN_CREDIT_BASE = 200000

	# Increase scaled credit limit multiplier
	# Default COUNTRY_MIN_CREDIT_SCALED = 0.5, increasing to 1.0 for more GDP-based credit
	COUNTRY_MIN_CREDIT_SCALED = 1.0
}

# Note: These defines make the bond market system more prominent by:
# 1. Allowing countries to borrow more (doubled base credit limit)
# 2. Making credit more GDP-dependent (doubled scaled credit multiplier)
# 3. Letting the trust system create more meaningful interest rate and credit capacity variations
