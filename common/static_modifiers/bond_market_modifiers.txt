# Bond Market Trust Tier Modifiers
# These modifiers affect loan interest rates based on country bond trust
# Lower trust = higher interest rates (penalty for risky borrowing)
# Higher trust = lower interest rates (reward for good credit)

# Low Trust (0-33): High interest penalty and reduced credit capacity
bond_trust_tier_low = {
	country_loan_interest_rate_add = 0.04  # +4% interest rate
	building_cash_reserves_mult = -0.2  # -20% cash reserves for all buildings
}

# Medium Trust (34-66): Neutral effects
bond_trust_tier_medium = {
	country_loan_interest_rate_add = 0.0  # No interest rate change
	# No cash reserves modifier for medium trust - neutral effect
}

# High Trust (67-100): Interest bonus and increased credit capacity
bond_trust_tier_high = {
	country_loan_interest_rate_add = -0.02  # -2% interest rate
	building_cash_reserves_mult = 0.15  # +15% cash reserves for all buildings
}
