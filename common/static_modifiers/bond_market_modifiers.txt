# Bond Market Trust Tier Modifiers
# These modifiers affect loan interest rates based on country bond trust
# Lower trust = higher interest rates (penalty for risky borrowing)
# Higher trust = lower interest rates (reward for good credit)

# Tier 0-19: Very Low Trust - Highest interest penalty
bond_trust_tier_0_19 = {
	country_loan_interest_rate_add = 0.05  # +5% interest rate
	building_cash_reserves_mult = -0.3  # -30% cash reserves for all buildings, reducing credit capacity
}

# Tier 20-39: Low Trust - High interest penalty
bond_trust_tier_20_39 = {
	country_loan_interest_rate_add = 0.03  # +3% interest rate
	building_cash_reserves_mult = -0.15  # -15% cash reserves for all buildings
}

# Tier 40-59: Medium Trust - Moderate interest penalty
bond_trust_tier_40_59 = {
	country_loan_interest_rate_add = 0.01  # +1% interest rate
	# No cash reserves modifier for medium trust - neutral effect
}

# Tier 60-79: High Trust - Low interest bonus
bond_trust_tier_60_79 = {
	country_loan_interest_rate_add = -0.01  # -1% interest rate
	building_cash_reserves_mult = 0.1  # +10% cash reserves for all buildings
}

# Tier 80-100: Very High Trust - Best interest bonus
bond_trust_tier_80_100 = {
	country_loan_interest_rate_add = -0.03  # -3% interest rate
	building_cash_reserves_mult = 0.2  # +20% cash reserves for all buildings, significantly increasing credit capacity
}
