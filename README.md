# Bond Market LPR

Bond Market LPR is a Victoria 3 mod that implements a dynamic bond market system with country trust mechanics.

The mod introduces a bond trust system that affects loan interest rates and credit capacity based on a country's economic performance and stability. Countries build trust through responsible economic management and lose it through default, high debt, or economic mismanagement.

## Features

- **Dynamic Trust System**: Monthly trust updates based on economic conditions
- **Interest Rate Modifiers**: 5 trust tiers with varying loan interest rate effects
- **Credit Capacity Effects**: Building cash reserves affected by trust levels
- **Debug Tools**: Journal entry and decisions for monitoring and testing
- **Enhanced Credit Limits**: Increased base credit and GDP-based credit multipliers

## Balancing Design Principles

One of the major balancing design principles of LPR mods is that big powerful countries will be crippled by powerful communist and revolutionaries currents, while smaller countries get better ways to build and grow than in the base game. This creates a more dynamic and balanced global landscape where established powers face greater internal challenges, while emerging nations have enhanced opportunities for development and expansion.
